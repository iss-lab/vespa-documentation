title: "Vector Search"
---

<p>
  Vector Search is a method to search objects using a digital representation of both the query and the objects -
  easier explained by example:
</p>
<p>
  Consider a user searching for the flower "Dandelion".
  A regular text search will match <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraxacum">this Wikipedia article</a>,
  as the "dandelion" term is in the text:
</p>
<p>
  <span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1.8em; font-family: 'Linux Libertine','Georgia','Times',serif;">
  Taraxacum</span>
<p>
<hr/>
<p style="font-size: 92%; font-family: sans-serif;">
  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from <span style="background-color: yellow;">Dandelion</span>)
</p>
<blockquote style="font-family: sans-serif;">
  "<span style="background-color: yellow;">Dandelion</span>" redirects here.
  It may refer to any species of the genus Taraxacum or specifically to Taraxacum officinale.
  For similar plants, see False <span style="background-color: yellow;">dandelion</span>.
  For other uses, see <span style="background-color: yellow;">Dandelion</span> (disambiguation)
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family: sans-serif;">
  <strong><em>Taraxacum</em></strong> (/təˈræksəkʊm/) is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae,
  which consists of species commonly known as dandelions.
</p>
<p>
  ...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
  This document is about dandelions, for sure.
  However, if the user searches for "blowball" (the mature spherical seed head of a dandelion),
  the text above will not match, although the document is a good match for "blowball".
  Example images of a dandelion:
</p>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/DandelionFlower.jpg"
     alt="DandelionFlower.jpg" width="220" height="176" />
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/TaraxacumOfficinaleSeed.JPG"
     alt="DandelionFlower.jpg" width="220" height="165" />

<p>
  This gets more complicated with more content types.
  It is hard to use text search to match the images without any text.
  The same goes for videos, podcasts, songs, TV shows, and so on - this is often called multi-modal search.
  A workaround is to search the object’s textual metadata, like a song’s title, the podcast episode summary,
  and the image’s <em>alt</em> text on the webpage.
  Such metadata is only sometimes available and is often too short/imprecise - this does not solve the root problem.
</p>
<p>
  The query can be an image itself or a song, where the users want <em>more like this</em>,
  in the context of the current song or an image being viewed.
  This is a problem found in recommender systems.
</p>



<h2 id="digital-representations">Digital representations</h2>
<p>
  A solution to the synonym or multi-modal problem is to change from matching in the textual to the digital domain.
  This means transforming text, images, and songs into a set of numbers that indicate what it is <em>about</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of different objects, and their vector representation:
</p>
<style>
  table {
    border-collapse: separate;
    border-spacing: 0 10px;
    margin-left: 40px;
  }
  td {
    vertical-align: top;
  }
</style>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/DandelionFlower.jpg"
             alt="DandelionFlower.jpg" width="55" height="44"/></td>
    <td><strong>[0.560, 0.001, 0.223, ...]</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/img/dandelion-song.png" alt="Dandelion bu Anna of the North"/></td>
    <td><strong>[0.0, 0.011, 0.0, ...]</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 30%;">
    "Taraxacum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae,
    which consists of species commonly known as dandelions."</td>
    <td><strong>[0.002, 0.001, 0.411, ...]</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dandelions</td>
    <td><strong>[0.002, 0.021, 0.355, ...]</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  The digital representation of the object is hence a sequence of numbers,
  called a <em>vector</em>, also called an <em>embedding</em>.
</p>
<p>
  By converting all the objects searched for <em>and</em> the query to vectors (digital representations),
  the search problem is changed into finding similar vectors - i.e., <em>vector search</em>.
</p>



<h2 id="how-vectors-are-created">How vectors are created</h2>
<p>
  Creating vectors from the objects can be done in multiple ways.
  Machine learning is often used; there are many ready-made models to get you started.
</p>
<p>
  The quality of the vectors will decide the quality of the search,
  so this is where organizations will want to spend their effort improving search.
</p>
<p>
  A vector has a <em>dimension</em> (length) and type (type of each cell).
</p>
<p>
  The cost/quality tradeoff is essential -
  given a vector, it can be represented with lower precision or shortened, keeping the most relevant dimensions.
  This reduces search precision, but cuts costs into a fraction.
  A 75% cost reduction might reduce precision, but acceptable for the use case.
  Vespa supports <a href="reference/tensor.html">four types</a>, with an 8x difference in memory cost:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Int8</th><td>8 bits, 1 byte per dimension</td></tr>
  <tr><th>bfloat16&nbsp;&nbsp;</th><td>16 bits, 2 bytes per dimension</td></tr>
  <tr><th>float</th><td>32 bits, 4 bytes per dimension</td></tr>
  <tr><th>double</th><td>64 bits, 8 bytes per dimension</td></tr>
</table>

</ul>
<p>
  Vectors are often some hundred numbers long, like 768 or 384.
  A longer vector can hold more information, but some dimensions are more information-rich than others.
  If most of the values in a dimension are equal or very close to each other,
  the dimension has little value and can be eliminated:

    Dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  A better approach is often to use an ML model with the optimal size from the start for the use case, once found.
</p>



<h2 id="doing-a-vector-search">Doing a vector search</h2>
<p>
  "dandelion" matches "dandelion", but "rose" does not.
  Text search has a binary nature.
  However, both are flowers and considered more similar to each other than "airplane".
  Unlike text matching, a vector search will not match items exactly.
  In the following example,
  we are using a very short 3-dim vector for simplicity and using the dimensions as coordinates in a 3D space:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/3Dplot.png" alt="Nearest neighbor scatter plot" />
<p>
  We see that <span style="color: #1071e5; font-weight: bold;">[0.000, 0.497, 0.110]</span>
  is not equal to <span style="color: #e81313; font-weight: bold;">[0.101, 0.560, 0.093]</span>, but quite close -
  closer than <span style="color: #2ca02c; font-weight: bold;">[0.611, 0.000, 0.217]</span>.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, if the values for each dimension are close, the vectors are similar -
  and this can be used in search to find the <em>nearest neighbor</em> or NN.
  There are multiple ways to calculate vector similarity using a <em>distance metric</em>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="reference/schema-reference.html#distance-metric">distance-metric</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="approximate-for-speed">Approximate for speed</h2>
<p>
  Calculating vector similarity can be thought of as multiplying the number of dimensions with the number of vectors.
  If you are a Canadian, represented by a 768-dim vector,
  this is 768 x 39,000,000 = 29,952,000,000, or 29 billion calculations to find the other Canadian most similar to you.
</p>
<p>
  There are ways to approximate this by doing fewer calculations,
  and still finding the closest vector with high probability -
  this is called <em>Approximate Nearest Neighbor search</em>, or <em>ANN search</em>.
  Vespa supports both exact nearest neighbor search and ANN search:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="approximate-nn-hnsw.html">approximate-nn-hnsw</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Note that ANNs require some kind of indexing to speed up search,
  so inserts (adding a new vector) are more expensive (uses more CPU) and takes more space (memory and disk).
  When evaluating different kinds of ANN indexing,
  consider if your use case requires updates, including deletes, to the vectors - Vespa supports all.

<h2 id="optimizing-vector-search">Optimizing vector search</h2>


<h3 id="centroids">Centroids</h3>
<p>
  Even after adding an index like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320">HNSW</a>,
  there are ways to optimize the search further.
  Using the Canadian example, if we only consider location and you live in Ontario,
  it is evident that your nearest neighbor lives in Ontario, Manitoba, or Quebec
  (current and neighbor states - not the ones farther away).
  The same goes with the full vectors -
  if we assign vectors to a centroid (think of this as the midpoint or average vector in a cluster),
  we can find the closest centroids and look at the vectors set to these centroids.
  This is a way to eliminate the vectors with the longest distance from you quickly.
</p>
<p>
  Another strategy is using multiphased ranking.
  The centroid examples linked above also use multiphase ranking; this is general:
  Run the query with increasingly intensive calculations to fine-tune the ranking of the candidate vectors.
  In another way, use cheap calculations to discard long-distance vectors, spending most resources on the closest.

</p>


<h3 id="bitwise-operations">Bitwise operations</h3>
<p>
  As the Int8 type is an integer, it can be used to represent bits used in distance metrics like Hamming distance.
  A 768-bit vector can be represented using 96 bytes.
  This is then used in <a href="https://blog.vespa.ai/billion-scale-knn/#representing-hash-like-binary-codes-in-vespa">
  hash-like binary-codes</a> to implement cost efficient first phase retrieval functions.
