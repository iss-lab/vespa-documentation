<p>
  Slobrok is an acronym for <em>Service Location Broker</em>,
  and it is a name service used in Vespa.
  The service listens on a specific port -
  use <a href="/en/operations-selfhosted/vespa-cmdline-tools.html#vespa-model-inspect">vespa-model-inspect</a>
  to find the <code>Slobrok</code> service's port number.
</p>
<p>
  Slobrok is running by default on the administration node as well as one or two other random nodes for redundancy.
  Best practise for a multi-node, high-availability application is found in the
  <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/examples/operations/multinode-HA">multinode-HA</a>
  sample application.
  In this application, slobrok instances are hosted on nodes running
  <a href="/en/operations-selfhosted/configuration-server.html">config servers</a>.
  The motivation is, like the config servers, Vespa requires slobrok to be up for services to function.
  Operating slobrok is the same as config servers, too - three is enough for most applications.
  As slobrok requires minimal system resources,
  it does not impact other services running on the same node -&gt;
  using config server nodes is ideal.
</p>
<p>
  Clients, like the <a href="/en/api.html">Document API</a>,
  will do lookups on any of the service location broker nodes.
  Slobrok is not used in the query pipeline.
  The <a href="/en/content/content-nodes.html#cluster-controller">cluster-controller</a>
  uses slobrok to evaluate service availability.

  The Slobrok process looks like:
