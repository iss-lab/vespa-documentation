<p>
  For some <a href="rank-features.html">rank features</a>,
  it is possible to set configuration variables for how the features are calculated.
  For features which are per field or attribute,
  the variables are set separately per field/attribute.
</p>



<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>
  Rank Features configuration variables are set by adding the following to the rank profile:
</p>
<pre>
rank-properties {
    &lt;featurename&gt;.&lt;configuration-property&gt;: &lt;value&gt;
}
</pre>
<p>
  Where <em>&lt;featurename&gt;</em> is the name of a feature class (feature name up to the first dot),
  <em>&lt;configuration-property&gt;</em> is a property from the list below,
  appropriate for the feature, and <em>&lt;value&gt;</em> is either a number of a quoted string.
  Example: set some properties on the fieldMatch and bm25 feature class of two different fields,
  and define custom outputs for the elementSimilarity feature for multi-valued field ranking. 
</p>
<pre>
ranking-profile my-profile inherits default {
  rank-properties {
    fieldMatch(title).maxAlternativeSegmentations: 10
    fieldMatch(title).maxOccurrences: 5
    fieldMatch(description).maxOccurrences: 20
    bm25(title).k1: 1.5
    bm25(title).b: 0.85
    bm25(title).averageFieldLength: 200
    elementSimilarity(tags).output.sumWeightSquared: "sum((0.35*p+0.15*o+0.30*q+0.20*f)*w^2)"
    elementSimilarity(tags).output.avgWeightSquared: "avg((0.35*p+0.15*o+0.30*q+0.20*f)*w^2)"
    elementSimilarity(tags).output.sumWeight: "sum(w)"
  }
  match-features {
    elementSimilarity(tags).sumWeightSquared
    elementSimilarity(tags).sumWeight
    bm25(title)
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
  Note that rank profiles can be inherited to use the same variables in multiple profiles.
</p>
