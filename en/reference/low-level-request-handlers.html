<p>
This document describes the low-level request handler APIs in Jdisc.
For implementing your own request handlers, please use
<a href="../jdisc/developing-request-handlers.html">Developing request handlers</a>
instead.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/RequestHandler.html">
com.yahoo.jdisc.service.RequestHandler</a>
interface defines a component that is capable of acting as a handler for a Request.
This document explains how to implement and deploy a custom request handler.
</p><p>
All request processing in a Container application is done by request handlers.
Implementations of the <code>RequestHandler</code> interface are bound to one or more URI patterns,
and invoked by <a href="developing-server-providers.html">server providers</a>
or other request handlers.
Upon receiving a request, the request handler must consume its content, process it,
and then return a response back to the provided <code>ResponseHandler</code>.
</p><p>
To implement a request handler, either implement the
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/RequestHandler.html">
RequestHandler</a> interface directly, or subclass the more convenient
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/AbstractRequestHandler.html">
    AbstractRequestHandler</a>.
</p><p>
Please note the following:
<ul>
  <li>All request handlers need to implement some <a href="#handling-a-request">request handling logic</a>,
  as well as some <a href="#dispatching-a-response">response dispatch logic</a>.</li>
  <li>In case a request handler needs to <a href="#dispatching-a-client-request">dispatch client requests</a>,
      it must also implement <a href="#handling-a-client-response">response handling logic</a>.</li>
  <li>A <a href="#request-timeout">request's timeout</a> is the maximum allowed time
    from when <code>handleRequest(Request, ResponseHandler)</code> is invoked
    until <code>handleResponse(Response)</code> must have been called.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="handling-a-request">Handling a request</h2>
<p>
A request handler is invoked by a call to its
<code>handleRequest(Request, ResponseHandler)</code> method.
As JDisc enforces no specific threading model,
this call can be run by any thread - even some critical IO thread that
belongs to one of the configured server providers.
Because of this, <span style="text-decoration: underline">never</span>
do much work in the body of the <code>handleRequest(Request, ResponseHandler)</code> method.
Instead, pass the necessary context to some known thread pool.
The <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ThreadedRequestHandler.html">
ThreadedRequestHandler</a>
provides an efficient implementation of such handover.
</p><p>
Once invoked, a request handler must create and return a <code>ContentChannel</code>
into which the caller can write the request's payload.
In no specific order, the request handler must now:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#reading-from-a-contentchannel">read the content</a> of the request, and</li>
  <li><a href="#dispatching-a-response">dispatch a response</a> to the given response handler.</li>
</ul>
</p>



<h2 id="reading-from-a-contentchannel">Reading from a ContentChannel</h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ContentChannel.html">
ContentChannel</a> provides an asynchronous interface for <code>ByteBuffer</code> handover -
where <em>handover</em> implies that the caller will never reuse the buffer.
The buffer may safely be stored and processed at some point in the future.
</p><p>
A content channel is required to be thread-safe.
It is the caller that is expected to do the external synchronization to avoid out-of-order calls -
a second call to <code>write(ByteBuffer, CompletionHandler)</code>
will never be initiated before the first call has returned.
</p><p>
The optional (in the sense that it might be <code>null</code>)
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/CompletionHandler.html">
CompletionHandler</a>
provides support for asynchronous notification of the completion or failure of a call to a content channel.
Notice that unless the implementation of the content channel throws an exception during a
<code>write(ByteBuffer, CompletionHandler)</code> or <code>close(CompletionHandler)</code>,
it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">required</span>
that one explicitly calls the corresponding completion handler at some point in the future.
</p><p>
Instead of developing a custom <code>ContentChannel</code>, consider using
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/BufferedContentChannel.html">
BufferedContentChannel</a>
if intending to forward the content without blocking or copying, or
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ReadableContentChannel.html">
ReadableContentChannel</a> if intending to access the content yourself.
</p>



<h2 id="dispatching-a-response">Dispatching a response</h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ResponseHandler.html">
ResponseHandler</a> is the callback to be invoked once a request has been sufficiently processed.
The response may be dispatched by any thread, and at any time -
even before the call to the request handler returns.
</p><p>
The response handler is the second argument of the request handler's
<code>handleRequest(Request, ResponseHandler)</code> method,
and it is commonly a one-off object.
</p><p>
Notice that unless the call to the request handler throws an exception,
it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">required</span> that you call the response handler
<span style="text-decoration: underline">exactly once</span> at some point in the future.
</p><p>
Once a response has been constructed, it is dispatched by calling
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ResponseHandler.html#handleResponse-com.yahoo.jdisc.Response-">
responseHandler.handleResponse(Response)</a>.
The returned <code>ContentChannel</code> must then be used to asynchronously
<a href="#writing-to-a-contentchannel">write the content</a> of the response into it.
Notice that unless the call to the response handler threw an exception,
it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">required</span>
that you explicitly close the returned content channel at some point in the future.
</p><p>
Instead of explicitly managing the dispatch of a response yourself, consider using the
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ResponseDispatch.html">
ResponseDispatch</a> utility class to safely dispatch the response.
</p>



<h2 id="writing-to-a-contentchannel">Writing to a ContentChannel</h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/ContentChannel.html">
ContentChannel</a> provides an asynchronous interface for <code>ByteBuffer</code> handover -
where <em>handover</em> implies that you may never reuse a buffer that you have written to it.
</p><p>
All content channels are thread-safe, but it is your responsibility to perform the
necessary synchronization to avoid out-of-order calls to it.
A second call to <code>write(ByteBuffer, CompletionHandler)</code>
should never be initiated before the first call has returned.
</p><p>
The optional (in the sense you are allowed to pass <code>null</code> for it)
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/CompletionHandler.html">
CompletionHandler</a> provides support for asynchronous notification of the completion
or failure of a call to a content channel.
Unless an exception is thrown in a call to <code>write(ByteBuffer, CompletionHandler)</code>
or <code>close(CompletionHandler)</code>,
you are guaranteed to have your completion handler called at some point in the future.
</p><p>
Note that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">required</span> to explicitly close all content channels -
regardless of whether some call to it threw an exception
or <code>failed(Throwable)</code> was invoked on some completion handler.
</p>



<h2 id="dispatching-a-client-request">Dispatching a client request</h2>
<p>
If a request handler decides to create and dispatch a
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/Request.html#Request-com.yahoo.jdisc.Request-java.net.URI-">
child-request</a>,
it is done through the same binding set mechanics that was used to resolve the current request handler.
However, where server providers resolve their dispatch against server-bindings,
request handlers will resolve their dispatch against client-bindings.
Override this behavior by using the
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/Request.html#setServerRequest-boolean-">
setServerRequest(boolean)</a> method.
Note that the request maintains a reference to the
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/service/CurrentContainer.html">
CurrentContainer</a>,
and that you are <span style="text-decoration: underline">required</span> to release the local reference
once the request has been dispatched,
to allow the JDisc Container to cleanly shut down at some point in the future.
</p><p>
Once the child-request and a response handler has been constructed, it is dispatched by calling
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/Request.html#connect-com.yahoo.jdisc.handler.ResponseHandler-">
request.connect(ResponseHandler)</a>.
The returned <code>ContentChannel</code> must then be used to asynchronously
<a href="#writing-to-a-contentchannel">write the content</a> of the request into it.
Note that unless the call to connect threw an exception,
it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">required</span> that you explicitly close
the returned content channel at some point in the future.
</p><p>
Instead of explicitly managing the dispatch of a request yourself, consider using the
<a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/jdisc_core/latest/com/yahoo/jdisc/handler/RequestDispatch.html">
RequestDispatch</a> utility class to safely dispatch requests.
</p>



<h2 id="handling-a-client-response">Handling a client response</h2>
<p>
As a client provider responds to a request,
the response handler that was part of the request dispatch is invoked.
</p><p>
Because JDisc enforces no specific threading model,
this call may be performed by any thread -
even some critical IO thread that belongs to one of the configured client providers.
Because of this you should <span style="text-decoration: underline">never</span>
do much work in the body of the <code>handleResponse(Response)</code> method.
</p><p>
Also, because the response may be dispatched at any time,
the response handler may be invoked even before the call to dispatch the request returns.
</p><p>
Once invoked, a response handler must create and return a <code>ContentChannel</code>
into which the caller can write the response's payload.
At some point in the future, this payload then needs be
<a href="#reading-from-a-contentchannel">consumed</a> and acted upon.
</p>



<h2 id="request-timeout">Request timeout</h2>
<p>
A request may or may not have an assigned timeout.
Such a timeout is the total amount of time that a request handler may spend processing a request
before the corresponding call to <code>handleResponse(Response)</code> is made.
If no timeout is assigned to a request, there will be no timeout.
Once the allocated time has expired, unless the response handler has already been called,
the request handler's <code>handleTimeout(Request, ResponseHandler)</code> method is invoked.
</p><p>
The <code>ResponseHandler</code> passed to the timeout method is the same
<code>ResponseHandler</code> that was initially passed to the <code>handleRequest()</code> method.
There is a built-in guard against calling the <code>ResponseHandler</code> more than once,
so you do not need additional synchronization to prevent a late response from calling the
handler of a request that has already timed out.
The <code>handleTimeout()</code> method is called by the timeout manager's own thread.
Any exception thrown in <code>handleTimeout()</code> is ignored.
</p><p>
Notice that you are <span style="text-decoration: underline">required</span>
to call the given response handler from within <code>handleTimeout(Request, ResponseHandler)</code>.
Failure to do so will prevent the JDisc Container from cleanly shutting down.
</p>
