<p>
  This document helps recognize the most common problems related to Unicode and I18N.
</p><p>
  UTF-8 is a Unicode specific encoding where each letter (code point)
  is encoded as one to four 8 bit bytes.
  The UTF-8 schema can technically use more bytes,
  but Unicode is defined as having approximately 1 million code points
  (partly on cause of limitations of UTF-16),
  and more than four bytes are then never necessary.
</p><p>
  A string in Java is stored as UTF-16, a series of 16 bits char(acter)s.
  All code points in Unicode base plane, the first 64k code points,
  is represented as a single char, while higher code points is represented using surrogate pairs.
  A surrogate pair is a pair of char from a reserved range.
</p><p>
  Accessing a code point in a Java string is done using e.g. String.codePointAt(),
  which then returns a 32-bit integer representing the code point (basically UCS-4).
  When traversing a string in Java, use codePointAt + offsetByCodePoints
  or String.codePoints() or similar methods.
  If your applications conceptually handles letters,
  using String.charAt() will most of the time be wrong.
  To calculate buffer sizes for UTF-8 buffers with UTF-16 inputs without doing speculative encoding,
  Vespa has a toolbox,
 <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/vespajlib/src/main/java/com/yahoo/text/Utf8.java">
    com.yahoo.text.Utf8</a>, with static helper methods.
</p>
<p>If you are using python, use the following to remove control characters:</p>
<pre>
def remove_control_characters(s):
    return "".join(ch for ch in s if unicodedata.category(ch)[0]!="C")
</pre>

<p>
  What we are looking for is single bytes outside ASCII, i.e. ordinal above 127.
  Given UTF-8, there should always be sequences of two or more of these
  when a code point is outside ASCII.
  The first byte for each code point will have the two most significant bits set,
  in other words hex C to hex F.
  The rest of the bytes for that code point will have the most significant bit set,
  and the second most unset, in other words hex 8 to hex B.
</p><p>
  From here, we move on to the two most common de-/encoding errors:
</p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Error</th><th>Hex dump of code points</th><th>Rendered</th>
  </tr>
  </thead><tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>UTF-8 input decoded as if it were ISO-8859-1</td>
      <td>h\xc3\xb4tel</td>
      <td>hÃ´tel</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td>UTF-8 input re-encoded as UTF-8, then decoded as UTF-8 again</td>
      <td>h\xc3\xb4tel</td>
      <td>hÃ´tel</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  Note how these two bugs create exactly the same byte sequences.
  This is because the first 256 code points of Unicode are identical to ISO-8859-1.
  What we are looking for is line noise in-between normal ASCII,
  as both ISO-8859-1 and Unicode are ASCII compatible.
</p><p>
  Trying to decode valid ISO-8859-1 input with a UTF-8 decoder will usually make
  the decoder report the input as invalid if there are code points outside ASCII.
  Valid ISO-8859-1 rarely end up conforming to the required bit patterns of valid UTF-8,
  though it sometimes happens.
</p><p>
  <em>Never</em> try to debug encoding problems with a web browser.
  Always use a hexdump tool.
  <code>xxd</code> is a nice utility which is included with vim,
  which avoids several of the endianness headaches associated with some UNIX alternatives.
</p><p>
  Also, remember Windows 1252 is <em>not</em> the same as ISO-8859-1.

<p>
  Use proper JSON - a common error is not stripping ASCII control characters from feed data.
  See <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/blob/master/vespajlib/src/main/java/com/yahoo/text/Text.java">
  stripInvalidCharacters</a> for a utility function.
