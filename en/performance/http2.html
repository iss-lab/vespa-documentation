  This document contains HTTP/2 performance considerations on the container—see
  <a href="container-tuning.html">Container tuning</a> for general tuning of container clusters.
</p>



<h2 id="enabling-http-2-on-container">Enabling HTTP/2 on container</h2>
<p>
  HTTP/2 is enabled on a container for all connectors with TLS/HTTPS configured (requires {% include version.html version="7.418.23" %} or newer).
  From {% include version.html version="7.462.20" %} HTTP/2 is available and enabled by default for connectors without TLS as well.
  We do recommend HTTP/2 with TLS, both for added security, but also for a more robust connection upgrade mechanism.
  Web browsers will typically only allow HTTP/2 over TLS.
</p>


<h3 id="http-2-with-tls">HTTP/2 with TLS</h3>
<p>
  Both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 will be served over the same connector using the
  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7301">TLS ALPN Extension</a>.
  The Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension allows the client to send a list of supported protocols
  during TLS handshake.
  The container selects a supported protocol from that list.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540">HTTP/2 specification</a>
  dictates multiple requirements for the TLS connection.
  Vespa may enforce some or all of these restrictions.
  See the HTTP/2 specification for the full list. The most significant are listed below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Client must use at least TLSv1.2.</li>
  <li>Client must provide target domain with the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) Extension.</li>
  <li>Client must not use any of the banned
    <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#appendix-A">TLSv1.2 ciphers</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="http-2-without-tls">HTTP/2 without TLS</h3>
<p>The jdisc container supports both mechanism for HTTP/2 without TLS - see <a href="#testing">testing</a>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Upgrading to HTTP/2 from HTTP/1</li>
  <li>HTTP/2 with prior knowledge</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="feeding-over-http-2">Feeding over HTTP/2</h2>
<p>
  One of the major improvements with HTTP/2 is multiplexing of multiple concurrent requests over a single TCP connection.
  This allows for high-throughput feeding through the
  <a href="../reference/document-v1-api-reference.html">/document/v1/</a> HTTP API,
  with a simple one-operation–one-request model,
  but without the overhead of hundreds of parallel connections that HTTP/1.1 would require for sufficient concurrency.
</p>
<p>
  <code>vespa feed</code> in the <a href="../vespa-cli.html#documents">Vespa CLI</a>
  and <a href="../vespa-feed-client.html">vespa-feed-client</a> use /document/v1/ over HTTP/2.
</p>



<h2 id="performance-tuning">Performance tuning</h2>


<h3 id="client">Client</h3>
<p>
  The number of multiple concurrent requests per connection is typically adjustable in HTTP/2 clients/libraries.
  Document v1 API is designed for high concurrency and can easily handle thousands of concurrent requests.
  Its implementation is asynchronous and max concurrency is not restricted by a thread pool size,
  so configure your client to allow enough concurrent requests/streams to saturate the feed container.
  Other APIs such as the <a href="../query-api.html">Query API</a> is backed by a synchronous implementation,
  and max concurrency is restricted by the
  <a href="container-tuning.html#container-worker-threads">underlying thread pool size</a>.
  Too many concurrent streams may result in the container rejecting requests with 503 responses.
</p>
<p>
  There are also still some reasons to use multiple TCP connections—even with HTTP/2:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Utilize multiple containers</strong>.
    A single container may not saturate the content layer.
    A client may have to use more connections than container nodes if the containers are behind a load balancer.</li>
  <li><strong>Higher throughput</strong>.
    Many clients allow only for a single thread to operate each connection.
    Multiple connections may be required for utilizing several CPU cores.
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="client-recommendations">Client recommendations</h2>
<p>
  Use <a href="../vespa-feed-client.html">vespa-feed-client</a> for feeding through Document v1 API (JDK8+).
</p>
<p>
  We recommend the <a href="https://nghttp2.org/documentation/h2load-howto.html">h2load benchmarking tool</a> for load testing.
  <a href="/en/operations/tools.html#vespa-fbench">vespa-fbench</a> does not support HTTP/2 at the moment.
</p>
<p>
  For Java there are 4 good alternatives:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://javadoc.jetty.org/jetty-11/org/eclipse/jetty/client/HttpClient.html">Jetty Client</a>
  <li><a href="https://square.github.io/okhttp/">OkHttp</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/">Apache HttpClient 5.x</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html">java.net.http.HttpClient (JDK11+)</a> </li>
</ol>



<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>
  The server does not perform a protocol upgrade if a request contains content (POST, PUT, PATCH with payload).
  This might be a limitation in Jetty, the HTTP server used in Vespa.
  Any client should assume HTTP/2 supported - example using <code>curl --http2-prior-knowledge</code>:
</p>
<pre>
$ curl -i --http2-prior-knowledge \
  -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @ext/A-Head-Full-of-Dreams.json \
