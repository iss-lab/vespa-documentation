<p>
  To model a geographical position in documents, use a field where the type is
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#position">position</a> for
  a single, required position.  To allow any number of positions
  (including none at all) use <code>array&lt;position&gt;</code> instead.
  This can be used to limit hits (only those documents with a position
  inside a circular area will be hits), the distance from a point can
  be used as input to ranking functions, or both.
</p>
<p>
  A geographical point in Vespa is specified using the geographical
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitude</a>
  and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitude</a>.
  As an example, a location in
  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/721+1st+Ave,+Sunnyvale,+CA+94089/@37.4181488,-122.0256157,12z">
    Sunnyvale, California</a>
  could be latitude 37.4181488 degrees North, longitude 122.0256157 degrees West.
  This would be represented as
  <code>{ "lat": 37.4181488, "lng": -122.0256157 }</code>
  in JSON.
</p>
<p>
  As seen above, positive numbers are used for north (latitudes) and
  east (longitudes); negative numbers are used for south and west.
  This is the usual convention.
</p>
{% include note.html content="Old formats for position (those used in Vespa 5, 6, and 7)
are still accepted as feed input; enabling legacy output is
temporarily possible also.  See
<a href='reference/default-result-format.html#geo-position-rendering'>legacy flag v7-geo-positions</a>." %}


<h2 id="sample-schema-and-document">Sample schema and document</h2>
<p>
  A sample schema could be a business directory, where every
  business has a position (for its main office or contact point):
</p>
<pre>
schema biz {
    document biz {
        field title type string {
            indexing: index
        }
        field mainloc type <span class="pre-hilite">position</span> {
            indexing: attribute | summary
        }
    }
    fieldset default {
        fields: title
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  Using this schema is one possible business entry with its location:
</p>
<pre>{% highlight json %}
{
    "put": "id:mynamespace:biz::business-1",
    "fields": {
        "title":      "Yahoo Inc (main office)",
        "mainloc":    { "lat": 37.4181488, "lng": -122.0256157 }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}</pre>



<h2 id="restrict">Restrict</h2>
<p>
  The API for adding a geographical restriction is to use a
  <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#geolocation">geoLocation</a> clause in the YQL statement,
  specifying a point and a maximum distance from that point:
<pre>
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"yql" : "select * from sources * where title contains \"office\" and geoLocation(mainloc, 37.416383, -122.024683, \"20 miles\")"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/search/
</pre>
<p>
  One can also build or modify the query programmatically by adding a
  <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/GeoLocationItem.html">
    GeoLocationItem</a> anywhere in the query tree.
</p>
<p>
  To use a position for ranking only (without <em>any</em> requirement for a matching position),
  specify it as a ranking-only term.
  Use the <a href="reference/query-language-reference.html#rank">rank()</a> operation in YQL for this, or a
  <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.yahoo.vespa/container-search/latest/com/yahoo/prelude/query/RankItem.html">RankItem</a>
  when building the query programmatically.
</p>
<p>
  At the <em>same time</em>, specify a negative radius (for example <code>-1 m</code>).
  This matches any position, and computes distance etc. for the closest position in the document. Example:
</p>
<pre>
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"yql" : "select * from sources * where rank(title contains \"office\", geoLocation(mainloc, 37.416383, -122.024683, \"-1 m\"))"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/search/
</pre>



<h2 id="ranking-from-a-position-match">Ranking from a position match</h2>
<p>
  The main rank feature to use for the example above would be
  <a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).km">distance(mainloc).km</a>
  and doing further calculation on it, giving better rank to documents
  that are closer to the wanted (query) position.
  Here one needs to take into consideration what sort of distances is practical;
  traveling on foot, by car, or by plane should have quite different
  ranking scales - using different rank profiles would be one natural
  way to support that.  If the query specifies a maximum distance, that
  could be sent as an input to ranking as well, and used for scaling.
</p>
<p>
  There is also a <a href="reference/rank-features.html#closeness(name)">closeness(mainloc)</a>
  which goes from 1.0 at the exact location to 0.0 at a tunable maximum distance,
  which is enough for many needs.
</p>


<h3 id="useful-summary-features">Useful summary-features</h3>
<p>
  To do further processing, it may be useful to get the computed distance back.
  The preferred way to do this is to use the associated rank features as
  <a href="reference/schema-reference.html#summary-features">summary-features</a>.
  In particular,
  <a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).km">distance(<em>fieldname</em>).km</a>
  gives the geographical distance in kilometers, while
  <a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).latitude">distance(<em>fieldname</em>).latitude</a> and
  <a href="reference/rank-features.html#distance(name).longitude">distance(<em>fieldname</em>).longitude</a>
  gives the geographical coordinates for the best location directly, in degrees.
  These are easy to use programmatically from a searcher, accessing
  <a href="ranking-expressions-features.html#accessing-feature-function-values-in-results">feature values in results</a>
  for further processing.
</p>

{% include note.html content="<code>geoLocation</code> doesn't do proper great-circle-distance calculations.
It works well for 'local' search (city or metro area), using simpler distance calculations.
For positions which are very distant or close to the international date line (e.g. the Bering sea),
the computed results may be inaccurate." %}

<h2 id="using-multiple-position-fields">Using multiple position fields</h2>
<p>
  For some applications, it can be useful to have several position attributes that may be searched.
  For example, we could expand the above examples with the locations of subsidiary offices:
<pre>
schema biz {
    document biz {
        field title type string {
            indexing: index
        }
        field mainloc type <span class="pre-hilite">position</span> {
            indexing: attribute | summary
        }
        field otherlocs type <span class="pre-hilite">array&lt;position&gt;</span> {
            indexing: attribute
        }
    }
    fieldset default {
        fields: title
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Expanding the example business with an office in Australia and one in Norway could look like:</p>
<pre>{% highlight json %}
{
    "put": "id:mynamespace:biz::business-1",
    "fields": {
        "title":       "Yahoo Inc (some offices)",
        "mainloc":     { "lat": 37.4, "lng": -122.0 },
        "otherlocs": [ { "lat": -33.9, "lng": 151.2 },
                       { "lat": 63.4, "lng": 10.4 } ]
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}</pre>
<p>
  A single query item can only search in one of the position attributes.
  For a search that spans several fields,
  use YQL to combine several <code>geoLocation</code> items inside an <code>or</code> clause,
  or combine several fields into a combined array field
  (so in the above example, one could duplicate the "mainloc" position into the "otherlocs" array as well,
  possibly changing the name from "otherlocs" to "all_locs").
</p>

<h2 id="distance-to-path">Distance to path</h2>
<p>
  This example provides an overview of the
  <a href="reference/rank-features.html#distanceToPath(name).distance">DistanceToPath</a>
  rank feature. This feature matches <em>document locations</em> to a path given in the query.
  Not only does this feature return the closest distance for each document to the path,
  it also includes the length traveled <em>along</em> the path before reaching the closest point,
  or <em>intersection</em>.
  This feature has been nick named the <em>gas</em> feature
  because of its obvious use case of finding gas stations along a planned trip.
</p>
<p>
  In this example we have been traveling from the US to Bangalore, and we
  are now planning our trip back. We have decided to rent a car in
  Bangalore that we are to return upon arrival at the airport in
  Chennai. We are already quite hungry and wish to stop for a meal once
  we are outside of town. To avoid having to pay an additional fueling
  premium, we also wish to refuel just before reaching the airport. We
  need to figure out what roads to take, what restaurants are available
  outside of Bangalore, and what fuel stations are available once we get close to Chennai.
  Here we have plotted our trip from Bangalore to the airport:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/geo/path1.png" alt="Trip from Bangalore to the airport"/>
<p>
  If we search for restaurants along the path,
  we only see a small subset of all restaurants present in the window of our quite large map.
  Here you see how the most relevant results are actually all in Bangalore or Chennai:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/geo/path2.png" alt="Most relevant results"/>
<p>
  To find the best results, move the map
  window to just about where we expect to be eating, and redo the search:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/geo/path3.png" alt="redo search with adjusted map"/>
<p>
  This has to be done similarly for finding a gas station near the airport.
  This illustrates searching for restaurants in a smaller window along the
  planned trip without <em>DistanceToPath</em>.
  Next, we outline how <em>DistanceToPath</em>
  can be used to quickly and easily improve this type of
  planning to be more convenient for the user.
</p>
<p>
  The nature of this feature requires that the search corpus contains documents with position data.
  A <a href="searcher-development.html">searcher component</a> needs to be
  written that is able to pass paths with the queries that lie in the
  same coordinate space as the searchable documents.
  Finally, a <a href="ranking.html">rank-profile</a> needs to defined that scores
  documents according to how they match some target distance traveled
  and at the same time lies close "enough" to the path.
</p>


<h3 id="query-syntax">Query Syntax</h3>
<p>
  This document does not describe how to write a searcher plugin for the Container,
  refer to the <a href="searcher-development.html">container documentation</a>.
  However, let us review the syntax expected by <em>DistanceToPath</em>.
  As noted in the the <a href="reference/rank-features.html#distanceToPath(name).distance">
  rank features reference</a>,
  the path is supplied as a query parameter by name of the feature and the <code>path</code> keyword:
</p>
<pre>
yql=(&hellip;)&amp;rankproperty.distanceToPath(<em>name</em>).path=(x1,y1,x2,y2,&hellip;,xN,yN)
</pre>
<p>
  Here <code>name</code> has to match the name of the position attribute that holds the positions data.
</p>
<p>
  The path itself is parsed as a list of <code>N</code> coordinate pairs
  that together form <code>N-1</code> line segments:
</p>
<p><!-- depends on mathjax -->
  $$(x_1,y_1) \rightarrow (x_2,y_2), (x_2,y_2) \rightarrow (x_3,y_3), (&hellip;), (x_{N-1},y_{N-1}) \rightarrow (x_N,y_N)$$
</p>
  {% include note.html content="The path is <em>not</em> in a readable (longitude, latitude) format,
  but is a pair of integers in the internal format (degrees multiplied by 1 million).
  If a transform is required from geographic coordinates to this, the search plugin must do it;
  note that the first number in each pair (the 'x') is longitude (degrees East or West)
  while the second ('y') is latitude (degrees North or South), corresponding to the usual orientation for maps -
  <em>opposite</em> to the usual order of latitude/longitude."%}


<h3 id="rank-profile">Rank profile</h3>
<p>
  If we were to disregard our scenario for a few moments, we could suggest the following rank profile:
</p>
<pre>
rank-profile default {
    first-phase {
        expression: nativeRank
    }
    second-phase {
        expression: firstPhase * if (distanceToPath(ll).distance &lt; 10000, 1, 0)
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  This profile will first rank all documents according to Vespa's
  <em>nativeRank</em> feature, and then do a second pass over the top 100
  results and order these based on their distance to our path.
  If a document lies within 100 metres of our path it
  retains its relevancy, otherwise its relevancy is set to 0.  Such a
  rank profile would indeed solve the current problem,
  but Vespa's ranking model allows for us to take this a lot further.
</p>
<p>
  The following is a rank profile that ranks documents
  according to a query-specified target distance to path and distance traveled:
</p>
<pre>
rank-profile default {
    first-phase {
        expression {
            max(0,    query(distance) - distanceToPath(ll).distance) *
            (1 - fabs(query(traveled) - distanceToPath(ll).traveled))
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
  The expression is two-fold; a first component determines a rank based
  on the document's distance to the given path as compared to
  the <a href="reference/ranking-expressions.html">query parameter</a>
  <code>distance</code>. If the allowed distance is exceeded, this
  component's contribution is 0. The distance contribution is then
  multiplied by the difference of the actual distance traveled as
  compared to the query parameter <code>traveled</code>. In short, this
  profile will include all documents that lie close enough to the path,
  ranked according to their actual distance and traveled measure.
</p>
{% include note.html content="<em>DistanceToPath</em> is only compatible
with <em>2D coordinates</em> because pathing in 1 dimension makes no sense."%}


<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>
  For the sake of this example, assume that we have implemented a
  custom path searcher that is able to pass the path found by the user's
  initial directions query to Vespa's <a href="#query-syntax">query syntax</a>.
  There are then two more parameters that must be supplied
  by the user; <code>distance</code> and <code>traveled</code>. Vespa
  expects these parameters to be supplied in a scale compatible with the
  feature's output, and should probably also be mapped by the container
  plugin. The feature's <em>distance</em> output is given in
  Vespa's internal resolution, which is approximately 10 units per
  meter. The <em>traveled</em> output is a normalized number
  between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the beginning of the path, and 1
  is the end of the path.
</p>
<p>
  This illustrates how these parameters can be used to return
  the most appropriate hits for our scenario. Note that the figures only
  show the top hit for each query:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/geo/path4.png" alt="Top tip 1"/>
<img src="/assets/img/geo/path5.png" alt="Top tip 2"/>
<ol>
  <li>Searching for restaurants with the DistanceToPath feature.
    <code>distance = 1000, traveled = 0.1</code></li>
  <li>Searching for gas stations with the DistanceToPath feature.
    <code>distance = 1000, traveled = 0.9</code></li>
</ol>
